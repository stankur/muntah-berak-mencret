# Active Context: Section Extraction Research Tool

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing the basic functionality for the Section Extraction Research Tool. This initial phase is centered on creating a minimal viable product that allows users to input content, save it as markdown files, and provide basic feedback on the operation's success or failure.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic project structure using SvelteKit
- Implemented a simple form UI with title input and content textarea
- Added a save button with basic styling
- Created a server-side API endpoint for saving content to the filesystem
- Implemented file system operations for creating the persistence directory and saving files
- Added basic validation and error handling
- Set up the memory bank documentation structure

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Tagging System**:
   - Add UI for tagging content
   - Extend the server endpoint to handle tags
   - Update file storage to include tag information

2. **Content Listing**:
   - Create a page to list all saved content
   - Implement filtering by tags
   - Add basic search functionality

3. **Content Viewing**:
   - Add a page to view saved content
   - Implement markdown rendering
   - Add navigation between content items

4. **LLM Integration Planning**:
   - Research integration options for LLM processing
   - Design the section extraction algorithm interface
   - Plan the data structure for storing extraction results

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### File Naming and Organization
- Currently using sanitized titles as filenames
- Considering adding unique identifiers to prevent overwriting
- Evaluating folder structure options for organizing content by tags or categories

### Content Format
- Currently saving raw content as markdown
- Considering adding metadata section for tags and other information
- Evaluating structured formats for storing extraction results alongside original content

### UI Enhancement
- Maintaining minimal UI for now
- Planning improvements for usability without adding unnecessary complexity
- Considering feedback mechanisms for successful operations

### Tagging Implementation
- Deciding between simple comma-separated tags or more structured tag management
- Evaluating storage options for tag information (in filename, in content, separate metadata file)
- Considering tag suggestion functionality based on content analysis

## Current Limitations
- No content management features (edit, delete)
- Limited feedback on save operations (simple alerts)
- No content organization beyond basic file saving
- No visualization of section structures
- No integration with LLM processing yet

## Development Environment
- Local development using SvelteKit dev server
- File persistence in local filesystem
- Manual testing of save functionality
