# Product Context: Section Extraction Research Tool

## Purpose
The Section Extraction Research Tool serves as a data collection and management system for a research project focused on hierarchical text structure analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the need for a straightforward way to collect, store, and organize text samples that will be used in experiments to develop and evaluate section extraction and construction algorithms.

## Problems Solved
1. **Research Data Collection**: Provides a simple way to collect and store text samples from various sources (blog posts, ebooks, articles) for research purposes.
2. **Content Organization**: Enables tagging and organization of collected content for systematic experimentation.
3. **Local Persistence**: Stores content as markdown files on the local filesystem, making them easily accessible for processing by LLM systems.
4. **Research Workflow Support**: Streamlines the process of gathering and preparing content for section extraction experiments.

## Research Focus Areas
1. **Section Extraction**: Analyzing texts with existing section titles to determine hierarchical relationships (parent sections, subsections) without prior knowledge of the hierarchy.
2. **Section Construction**: Breaking down long, unstructured texts (without explicit section markers) into a logical hierarchical structure of sections and subsections.
3. **LLM Method Comparison**: Using the collected content to evaluate different LLM techniques and approaches to determine which produces the most accurate and useful results.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a title for the content in the title input field.
2. The user pastes or writes content (from blog posts, ebooks, etc.) into the content textarea.
3. When the user clicks the "Save" button, the application:
   - Validates that both title and content are provided
   - Sanitizes the title to create a valid filename
   - Creates a "persistence" directory in the project root if it doesn't exist
   - Saves the content as a markdown file named after the sanitized title
   - Provides feedback to the user about the success or failure of the operation

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: The interface is intentionally minimal, focusing on the core functionality of content collection.
2. **Efficiency**: Quick copy-paste workflow for gathering content from various sources.
3. **Feedback**: Clear alerts inform the user about the success or failure of save operations.
4. **Reliability**: Basic validation ensures that files are saved correctly with proper names.

## Intended Use Cases
- Collecting text samples from blog posts for section extraction experiments
- Saving content from ebooks rendered in web readers
- Building a dataset of texts with varying structural complexity
- Organizing research materials for systematic experimentation with LLM techniques
