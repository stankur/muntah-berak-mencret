# Progress: Section Extraction Research Tool

## What Works
- ✅ Basic project structure and configuration
- ✅ Form UI with title input and content textarea
- ✅ Save button with click handler
- ✅ Client-side validation of inputs
- ✅ Server-side API endpoint for saving content
- ✅ File system operations for creating persistence directory
- ✅ Saving content as markdown files
- ✅ Title sanitization for safe filenames
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback via alerts
- ✅ Memory bank documentation structure

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ Tagging system for content organization
- ⬜ Content listing page
- ⬜ Content viewing page with markdown rendering
- ⬜ Search functionality
- ⬜ Content management (edit, delete)
- ⬜ Better UI/UX with improved styling
- ⬜ Section extraction algorithm integration
- ⬜ Section visualization components
- ⬜ LLM processing integration
- ⬜ Results comparison tools

## Current Status
The project is in its initial development phase. The core functionality for inputting and saving content has been implemented, providing a minimal viable product. The application can now:

1. Accept a title and content from the user
2. Validate the inputs
3. Save the content as a markdown file in the persistence directory
4. Provide feedback on the operation's success or failure

The current implementation focuses on functionality rather than aesthetics, with minimal styling applied to the UI components.

## Known Issues
1. **Overwriting Files**: Files with the same sanitized title will overwrite each other without warning
2. **Limited Feedback**: User feedback is limited to basic browser alerts
3. **No Content Management**: No way to view, edit, or delete saved content
4. **No Content Organization**: No tagging or categorization system implemented yet
5. **Path Resolution**: The persistence directory path is resolved using `process.cwd()`, which may not be ideal in all deployment environments

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Content Saving (Completed)

- ✅ Implement server endpoint
- ✅ Add file system operations
- ✅ Implement validation and error handling

### Milestone 2: Content Organization (Planned)
- ⬜ Implement tagging system
- ⬜ Create content listing page
- ⬜ Add filtering and search
- ⬜ Improve file naming and organization

### Milestone 3: Content Management (Planned)
- ⬜ Create content viewing page
- ⬜ Add edit functionality
- ⬜ Add delete functionality
- ⬜ Implement markdown rendering

### Milestone 4: LLM Integration (Planned)
