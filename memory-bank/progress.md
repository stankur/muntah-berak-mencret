# Progress: Section Extraction Research Tool

## What Works
- ✅ Basic project structure and configuration
- ✅ Form UI with title input and content textarea
- ✅ Save button with click handler
- ✅ Client-side validation of inputs
- ✅ Server-side API endpoints for saving, listing, and retrieving content
- ✅ File system operations for creating persistence directory
- ✅ Saving content as markdown files
- ✅ Title sanitization for safe filenames
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback via alerts
- ✅ Memory bank documentation structure
- ✅ Content listing and selection
- ✅ Content viewing with markdown rendering
- ✅ Process registry system with TypeScript generics
- ✅ Identity process implementation
- ✅ Line numbering process implementation
- ✅ Process selection UI
- ✅ Multiple content selection for batch processing
- ✅ Process execution with console logging

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ Process result visualization (currently only logging to console)
- ⬜ Additional process implementations for different transformations
- ⬜ Persistence for process results
- ⬜ Tagging system for content organization
- ⬜ Search functionality
- ⬜ Content management (edit, delete)
- ⬜ Better UI/UX with improved styling
- ⬜ Section extraction algorithm integration
- ⬜ Section visualization components
- ⬜ LLM processing integration
- ⬜ Results comparison tools

## Current Status
The project has progressed beyond the initial phase and now includes a process registry system with multiple process implementations. The application can now:

1. Accept a title and content from the user
2. Validate the inputs
3. Save the content as a markdown file in the persistence directory
4. List and display saved content
5. Define processes that transform content
6. Register processes in a central registry
7. Select a process and multiple content items
8. Execute the selected process on the selected content
9. Log process results to the console

The latest addition is a line numbering process that adds sequential numbers to content blocks while treating tables, lists, and other special elements as single units. This process:
1. Adds line numbers to each content block (e.g., "1:", "2:", etc.)
2. Skips empty lines when counting
3. Treats tables, lists, code blocks, and blockquotes as single blocks
4. Ensures line numbers always start on a new line
5. Intelligently skips numbering figure captions, table captions, and other special elements

The implementation continues to focus on functionality rather than aesthetics, with minimal styling applied to the UI components.

## Known Issues
1. **Overwriting Files**: Files with the same sanitized title will overwrite each other without warning
2. **Limited Feedback**: User feedback is limited to basic browser alerts
3. **No Content Management**: No way to view, edit, or delete saved content
4. **No Content Organization**: No tagging or categorization system implemented yet
5. **Path Resolution**: The persistence directory path is resolved using `process.cwd()`, which may not be ideal in all deployment environments

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Content Saving (Completed)

- ✅ Add file system operations
- ✅ Implement validation and error handling

### Milestone 2: Content Organization (Planned)
- ⬜ Implement tagging system
- ⬜ Create content listing page
- ⬜ Add filtering and search
- ⬜ Improve file naming and organization

### Milestone 3: Content Management (Planned)
- ⬜ Create content viewing page
- ⬜ Add edit functionality
- ⬜ Add delete functionality
- ⬜ Implement markdown rendering

### Milestone 4: LLM Integration (Planned)
- ⬜ Design section extraction algorithm interface
