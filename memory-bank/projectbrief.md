# Project Brief: Section Extraction Research Tool

## Overview
This project is part of a research initiative focused on extracting and analyzing hierarchical section structures from text using LLMs (Large Language Models). The application provides a simple interface for inputting, saving, and tagging content that will be used as the basis for experiments in section extraction and hierarchical structure analysis.

## Core Requirements
1. A text input field for the title of the content
2. A textarea for entering or pasting content (blog posts, ebook excerpts, etc.)
3. A save button to persist the content as markdown files
4. Server-side functionality to save files to the local filesystem
5. Basic validation and error handling
6. Minimal styling and UI

## Research Goals
1. **Section Extraction**: Extract data about sections and their hierarchical structure from texts that already have section titles, determining parent-child relationships between sections.
2. **Section Construction**: Break down long texts without explicit section markers into a hierarchical structure of sections and subsections.
3. **LLM Experimentation**: Use the collected content as a dataset for experimenting with various LLM techniques to determine which methods produce the best results.

## Current Phase Goals
- Create a simple, functional content storage system
- Implement file system persistence for collected content
- Enable tagging of content for organization
- Keep the interface minimal and focused on functionality
- Ensure proper validation and error handling

## Non-Goals (Current Phase)
- Complex styling or UI enhancements
- Implementation of the actual LLM processing
- Advanced content management features
- User authentication or multi-user support

## Future Considerations
- Implementing the LLM-based section extraction algorithms
- Adding visualization of extracted hierarchical structures
- Implementing comparison tools for different extraction methods
- Adding content management features (edit, delete, search)
- Enhancing the UI with better styling
